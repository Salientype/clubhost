"Club Host, where lifetime bonds are made"

Welcome to "Club Host" authenticated users can create and join groups where they can then create and join community created activities/events open to all group members.

This web app was created to meet specific detailed project criteria from back-end applications including Sequelize, Postgres, Express and a host of NPM middleware.

Varying portions of this project were contributed by several members of a group.

This is a WIP, but thanks for checking it out and we hope you enjoy the vision.
